    <div class="c"><b>Social belonging is so important that it’s recognised as a human need. Our friendships play a critical role in our happiness. Friendship provides people with companionship and affection and creates a space where we can feel valued and cared for.Having positive social connections can help people to improve and maintain good mental health. Social support also helps us to manage stress better, and even appears to positively improve a range of physical health outcomes like cardiovascular disease. Spending time with friends and family is one of the most popular ways people manage stress – and it works. Our families, friends and colleagues are all important relationships in our lives that need to be nurtured, especially through times of adversity, such as the current coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.</b></div>
