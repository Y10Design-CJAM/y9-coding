<!-- The style section is very similar to the first few pages with the addition of the serif command. This is used to change the font of the button as it was different at first. Here I was just defining what serif is and what the font should be if it is used. -->
<!-- The feature below is used so that the leave button will bring you back to Google. I struggled with this for a bit and seeked a bit of help online. What is happening is that when thr button is clicked the action that is made is that it brings you to Google (www.google.com). The line below that is all about the location, type and text. The type part is used to control the function by when the button is clicked then the line above happens. The value function is the text that appear on the button. The input is used to control the color, font, and location. -->
<form action="https://google.com">
    <input class="a" type="submit" value="Leave" />
</form> 
<!-- This is the massive text that is located in the center of the page. The font is larger than normal because I changed the size in the style section. I also changed its location with the top and right feature and its color. -->
